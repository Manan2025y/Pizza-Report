## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure  

### 1. Database Setup  
```sql
CREATE TABLE pizza_sales (
    order_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    pizza_name VARCHAR(100),
    pizza_category VARCHAR(50),
    pizza_size VARCHAR(20),
    quantity INT,
    unit_price DECIMAL(10,2),
    total_price DECIMAL(10,2)
);
```

### 2. Data Import  
```sql
COPY pizza_sales
FROM 'C:\data\pizza_sales.csv'
DELIMITER ','
CSV HEADER;
```

## üìä SQL Analysis  

### A. KPI‚Äôs  
```sql
SELECT SUM(total_price) AS Total_Revenue FROM pizza_sales;
SELECT (SUM(total_price) / COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)) AS Avg_order_Value FROM pizza_sales;
SELECT SUM(quantity) AS Total_pizza_sold FROM pizza_sales;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_Orders FROM pizza_sales;
SELECT CAST(CAST(SUM(quantity) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) /
CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Avg_Pizzas_per_order FROM pizza_sales;
```

### B. Daily Trend for Orders  
```sql
SELECT DATENAME(DW, order_date) AS order_day, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS total_orders
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY DATENAME(DW, order_date);
```

### C. Monthly Trend for Orders  
```sql
SELECT DATENAME(MONTH, order_date) AS Month_Name, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_Orders
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY DATENAME(MONTH, order_date);
```

### D. % of Sales by Pizza Category  
```sql
SELECT pizza_category, CAST(SUM(total_price) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS total_revenue,
CAST(SUM(total_price) * 100 / (SELECT SUM(total_price) FROM pizza_sales) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS PCT
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_category;
```

### E. % of Sales by Pizza Size  
```sql
SELECT pizza_size, CAST(SUM(total_price) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS total_revenue,
CAST(SUM(total_price) * 100 / (SELECT SUM(total_price) FROM pizza_sales) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS PCT
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_size
ORDER BY pizza_size;
```

### F. Total Pizzas Sold by Category (Feb Only)  
```sql
SELECT pizza_category, SUM(quantity) AS Total_Quantity_Sold
FROM pizza_sales
WHERE MONTH(order_date) = 2
GROUP BY pizza_category
ORDER BY Total_Quantity_Sold DESC;
```

### G‚ÄìL. Product Performance  
```sql
-- Top 5 Pizzas by Revenue
SELECT TOP 5 pizza_name, SUM(total_price) AS Total_Revenue
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY Total_Revenue DESC;

-- Bottom 5 Pizzas by Revenue
SELECT TOP 5 pizza_name, SUM(total_price) AS Total_Revenue
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY Total_Revenue ASC;

-- Top 5 Pizzas by Quantity Sold
SELECT TOP 5 pizza_name, SUM(quantity) AS Total_Pizza_Sold
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY Total_Pizza_Sold DESC;

-- Bottom 5 Pizzas by Quantity Sold
SELECT TOP 5 pizza_name, SUM(quantity) AS Total_Pizza_Sold
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY Total_Pizza_Sold ASC;

-- Top 5 Pizzas by Orders
SELECT TOP 5 pizza_name, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_Orders
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY Total_Orders DESC;

-- Bottom 5 Pizzas by Orders
SELECT TOP 5 pizza_name, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_Orders
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY Total_Orders ASC;
```
